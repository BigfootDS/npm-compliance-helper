## Basic Usage

Default usage of this package will meet most peoples' needs.

Default usage will search for the `package.json` file in the current working directory and create license data based on that file.

### Command Line Usage

If using this package as a command line tool, you can pass in customisation options with these flags:

```bash
  -p, --packageJsonPath <packageJsonPath>            A path to a package.json. If not provided, the package.json in the current working directory will be used. (default: Result of `path.join(process.cwd(), "package.json")` )
  -lo, --licenseOverrides <licensesToOverride>       The licenses you want to allow in your project. (default: [])
  -ex, --excludedLicenses <excludedSpdxIdentifiers>  The licenses you want to forbid in your project. (default: [])
  -h, --help                                         display help for command

```

Please note that the license overrides and license exclusions are not yet implemented as of 4th May 2024.

Typical usage of this command may look like:

```bash
npx @bigfootds/npm-compliance-helper > ./out/organizedLicenseData.json
```

You could even create a bit of robust NPM/bash scripting like so, to guarantee that the `out` folder exists:

```bash
mkdir -p ./out && npx @bigfootds/npm-compliance-helper > ./out/organizedLicenseData.json
```

### Imported Package Usage

If you wish to use this package within your own JavaScript code, you can import the package like so:

```js
const {organiseProjectLicenseInfo} = require("@bigfootds/npm-compliance-helper");
```

You can provide that function with a custom path to a `package.json` file, or just give it nothing and it will find the `package.json` file in the current working directory.

Like so:

```js
async function someFunction(){
	let output = "";
	
	output = await organiseProjectLicenseInfo().catch(error => error);

	console.log(Object.keys(output));

	console.log(output.directDependencies);

	return output;
}
```
